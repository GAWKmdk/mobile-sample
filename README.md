Built with MeteorJS - Sample Quote List from Meteor Cookbook to test deployment options

Current fails due to "super-clean IT community" node packaging and ddp client configurations that don't support a no-bs transfer of service with the following: 

- Heroku (clean git cli integration - poor built packages - poor freemium to test and scale services platform with mongolab/mongohg and more robust paid services options ie:security,etc).
- IBM Bluemix (clean git cli integration - straightforward built package - poor support for freemium testing to scale or match first time users with service with paid services).
- Docker (demeteorize image package seems like a cover for more seo optimized stack overflows substitute little knowledge for express.js and node.js with more super helpful package dependence bundles ... its' also way too many steps to setup)
- Digital Ocean (** will try)
- Meteor Galaxy (Probably the best choice for simplicity and price -- just hope they have a way to set budgets for usage monitoring).
- AMAZON E2/S3 - Too complicate to setup since documentation is sporatic or outdates and does a poor job of providing the basics in preventing you from hardcoding your access tokens and other first time user security flaws).
